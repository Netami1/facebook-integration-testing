# Facebook Integration Tests Using Selenium

This repository shows examples of integration test functionality using Selenium with JUnit.
Facebook.com is used for a test platform, however similar tests can be applied to almost any website.

The goal of integration testing is to provide testing for when multiple software modules (such as micro-services) come together and must work with each other for the software to work. Integration tests provide additional coverage when used with unit tests, as bugs in the interactions between these modules can not be address in regular unit tests.
